# SonicSmart: Domain Adaptation for Quantity Prediction using Acoustic Features

ABSTRACT<br />
Estimation of the quantity of a household item inside a container can be useful for various ubiquitous computing applications including, but not limited to, automated shopping, household waste reduction, and recipe planning. Acoustic features provide a basis for building an inexpensive and versatile sensor which can be used with existing household containers. However, training a prediction model for each item is tiresome, and cannot be expected from target consumers of such a sensor. Therefore, it is desirable to build a prediction model which can readily adapt to novel sensor data produced by new items and environmental conditions.<br />
In this project, we study the domain adaptation of an acoustic sensor data to build a generic model which can predict the quantity of any household liquid inside a given container without user effort. We utilize commonly used acoustic features of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) coefficients to train our models. We then build a domain adaptation method to combine the information from various training liquids, and to adapt to a novel liquid. We present a comparative analysis of ridge-regularized linear regression and neural network based regression models.
